	abstract = {Existing safety assurance approaches for autonomous vehicles (AVs) perform system-level safety evaluation by placing the AV-under-test in challenging traffic scenarios captured by abstract scenario specifications and investigated in realistic traffic simulators. As a first step towards scenario-based testing of AVs, the initial scene of a traffic scenario must be concretized. In this context, the scene concretization challenge takes as input a high-level specification of abstract traffic scenes and aims to map them to concrete scenes where exact numeric initial values are defined for each attribute of a vehicle (e.g. position or velocity). In this paper, we propose a traffic scene concretization approach that places vehicles on realistic road maps such that they satisfy an extensible set of abstract constraints defined by an expressive scene specification language which also supports static detection of inconsistencies. Then, abstract constraints are mapped to corresponding numeric constraints, which are solved by metaheuristic search with customizable objective functions and constraint aggregation strategies. We conduct a series of experiments over three realistic road maps to compare eight configurations of our approach with three variations of the state-of-the-art Scenic tool, and to evaluate its scalability.},

However, automatically generating a diverse set of consistent graph models for complex domain specifications is challenging. First, the graph generation problem must be specified with mathematical precision. Moreover, graph generation is a computationally complex task, which necessitates specialized logic solvers. Refinery is a novel open-source software framework to automatically synthesize a diverse set of consistent domain-specific graph models. The framework offers an expressive high-level specification language using partial models to succinctly formulate a wide range of graph generation challenges. Moreover, it provides a modern cloud-based architecture for a scalable graph solver as a service, which uses logic reasoning rules to efficiently synthesize a diverse set of solutions to graph generation problems by partial model refinement.

	abstract = {Automatically synthesizing consistent models is a key prerequisite for many testing scenarios in autonomous driving to ensure a designated coverage of critical corner cases. An inconsistent model is irrelevant as a test case (e.g., false positive); thus, each synthetic model needs to simultaneously satisfy various structural and attribute constraints, which includes complex geometric constraints for traffic scenarios. While different logic solvers or dedicated graph solvers have recently been developed, they fail to handle either structural or attribute constraints in a scalable way. In the current paper, we combine a structural graph solver that uses partial models with an SMT-solver and a quadratic solver to automatically derive models which simultaneously fulfill structural and numeric constraints, while key theoretical properties of model generation like completeness or diversity are still ensured. This necessitates a sophisticated bidirectional interaction between different solvers which carry out consistency checks, decision, unit propagation, concretization steps. Additionally, we introduce custom exploration strategies to speed up model generation. We evaluate the scalability and diversity of our approach, as well as the influence of customizations, in the context of four complex case studies.},

	abstract = {Advanced tools used in model-based systems engineering (MBSE) frequently represent their models as graphs. In order to test those tools, the automated generation of well-formed (or intentionally malformed) graph models is necessitated which is often carried out by solver-based model generation techniques. In many model generation scenarios, one needs more refined control over the generated unit tests to focus on the more relevant models. Type scopes allow to precisely define the required number of newly generated elements, thus one can avoid the generation of unrealistic and highly symmetric models having only a single type of elements. In this paper, we propose a 3-valued scoped partial modeling formalism, which innovatively extends partial graph models with predicate abstraction and counter abstraction. As a result, well-formedness constraints and multiplicity requirements can be evaluated in an approximated way on incomplete (unfinished) models by using advanced graph query engines with numerical solvers (e.g., IP or LP solvers). Based on the refinement of 3-valued scoped partial models, we propose an efficient model generation algorithm that generates models that are both well-formed and satisfy the scope requirements. We show that the proposed approach scales significantly better than existing SAT-solver techniques or the original graph solver without multiplicity reasoning. We illustrate our approach in a complex design-space exploration case study of collaborating satellites introduced by researchers at NASA JPL.},

A graph model is (1) consistent if it is metamodel-compliant and it satisfies the well-formedness constraints of the domain; (2) it is diverse if local neighborhoods of nodes are highly different; and (1) it is structurally realistic if a synthetic graph is at a close distance to a representative real model according to various graph metrics used in network science, databases or software engineering. Our approach grows models by model extension operators using a hill-climbing strategy in a way that (A) ensures that there are no constraint violation in the models (for consistency reasons), while (B) more realistic candidates are selected to minimize a target metric value (wrt. the representative real model). We evaluate the effectiveness of the approach for generating realistic models using multiple metrics for guidance heuristics and compared to other model generators in the context of three case studies with a large set of real human models. We also highlight that our technique is able to generate a diverse set of models, which is a requirement in many testing scenarios.},

Validating constraints on incomplete, partial models may identify a large number of irrelevant problems.

Here, we propose a novel validation technique for evaluating well-formed- ness constraints on incomplete, partial models with may and must semantics, e.g. a constraint without a valid match is satisable if there is a completion of the partial model that may satisfy it. To this end, we map the problem of constraint evaluation over partial models into regular graph pattern matching over complete models by semantically equivalent rewrites of graph queries.},

	abstract = {In the early stages of model driven development, models are frequently incomplete and partial. Partial models represent multiple possible concrete models, and thus, they are able to capture uncertainty and possible design decisions. When using models of a complex modeling language, several well-formedness constraints need to be continuously checked to highlight conceptual design flaws for the engineers in an early phase. While well-formedness constraints can be efficiently checked for (fully specified) concrete models, checking the same constraints over partial models is more challenging since, for instance, a currently valid constraint may be violated (or an invalid constraint may be respected) when refining a partial model into a concrete model. In this paper we propose a novel technique to evaluate well-formedness constraints on partial models in order to detect if (i) a concretization may potentially violate or (ii) any concretization will surely violate a well-formedness constraint to help engineers gradually to resolve uncertainty without violating well-formedness. For that purpose, we map the problem of constraint evaluation over partial models into a regular graph pattern matching problem over complete models by semantically equivalent rewrites of graph queries.},

	abstract = {In model-driven development of safety-critical systems (like 
		automotive, avionics or railways), wellformedness
		of models is repeatedly validated in order to detect design 
		flaws as early as possible.
		Validation rules are often implemented by a large amount of 
		imperative model traversal code which
		makes those rule implementations complicated and hard to 
		maintain. Additionally as models are
		rapidly increasing in size and complexity, efficient 
		execution of these operations is challenging for
		the currently available toolchains. However, checking well-
		formedness constraints can be interpreted
		as evaluation of model queries, and the operations as model 
		transformations, where the validation
		task can be specified in a concise way, and executed 
		efficiently.
		This paper presents a benchmark case and an evaluation 
		framework to systematically assess the
		scalability of validating and revalidating well-formedness 
		constraints over large models. The benchmark
		case defines a typical well-formedness validation scenario in 
		the railway domain including
		the metamodel, an instance model generator, and a set of 
		well-formedness constraints captured by
		queries and repair operations (imitating the work of systems 
		engineers by model transformations).
		The benchmark case focuses on the execution time of the query 
		evaluations with a special emphasis
		on reevaluations, as well as simple repair transformations.},

	abstract = {Despite the wide range of existing generative tool support, constructing a design environment for a complex domain-specific language (DSL) is still a tedious task as the large number of derived features and well-formedness constraints complementing the domain metamodel necessitate special handling. Incremental model queries as provided by the EMF-IncQuery framework can (i) uniformly specify derived features and well-formedness constraints and (ii) automatically refresh their result set upon model changes. However, for complex domains, derived features and constraints can be formalized incorrectly resulting in incomplete, ambiguous or inconsistent DSL specifications. To detect such issues, we propose an automated mapping of EMF metamodels enriched with derived features and well-formedness constraints captured as graph queries in EMF-IncQuery into an effectively propositional fragment of first-order logic which can be efficiently analyzed by the Z3 SMT-solver. Moreover, overapproximations are proposed for complex query features (like transitive closure and recursive calls). Our approach will be illustrated on analyzing a DSL being developed for the avionics domain.},
